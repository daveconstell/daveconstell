# Guidelines for Submitting a Bug Report

## Introduction

A bug report is a document that describes an issue or defect in software. It provides developers with the necessary information to understand, reproduce, and fix the problem. Submitting clear and detailed bug reports is essential for effective software development and maintenance.

## What is a Bug Report?

A bug report is a formal document that outlines a problem in software. It serves as a communication tool between users, testers, and developers, detailing the nature of the issue and the conditions under which it occurs.

## Parts of a Bug Report

A well-structured bug report should include the following components:

### 1. Title

- A concise summary of the bug. It should capture the essence of the problem.

### 2. Description

- A detailed explanation of the bug. Include what the expected behavior is and what actually happened.

### 3. Steps to Reproduce

- A step-by-step guide to replicate the issue. This should be clear and detailed enough for someone else to follow.

### 4. Environment

- Information about the environment in which the bug occurred, such as:
  - Operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - Device type (e.g., desktop, mobile)
  - Browser version (if applicable)
  - Application version

### 5. Severity/Priority

- An indication of the bugâ€™s severity (e.g., minor, major, critical) and priority (e.g., low, medium, high). This helps developers prioritize their work.

### 6. Screenshots/Attachments

- Any relevant images or files that help illustrate the issue. Visual aids can provide additional context.

### 7. Additional Information

- Any other pertinent details that might help in diagnosing the problem, such as logs, error messages, or recent changes in the application.
